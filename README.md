# Real-time-Face-recognition-using-python
It is a project of face recognition in real time using web-cam and Python
facereco.py is the source code of this project
In order to run the whole code, 
1. Create two directories named- KNOWN_FACES and UNKNOWN_FACES.
2. Add an Image which is close to perfect for the computer to recognize initially.
3. Run the program and under perfect conditions the web-cam image will show "recognised" image frame.
4. For trial purpose I have added a picture of Elon Musk which is too be pasted in KNOWN_FACES folder.
5. After face recognition the recognised faces will be stored with their name and time in the Attendace.csv file.
